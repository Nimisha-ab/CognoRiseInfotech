# CognoRiseInfotech
This repo is about my python development internship works in CognoRise Infotech
Theree are 3 programs in this repo
  Simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
● Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.
● Perform the calculation and display the result
 PASSWORD GENERATOR
● A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords 
for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using 
Python, allowing user to specify the length and complexity of the password.
● User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
● Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a 
password of the specified length.
● Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.
DICE ROLLING SIMULATOR
● Create a simple Python program that simulates rolling dice. Users can specify the 
number of sides on the dice and the number of rolls. 
● The program generates random numbers for each roll and displays the results. 
● It's a quick and fun way to emulate the experience of rolling dice, commonly used 
in board games or tabletop role-playing games. 
● The simulator allows users to explore the outcomes of dice rolls without the 
physical dice.
